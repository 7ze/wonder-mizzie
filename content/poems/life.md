Life hides in places you never look

I wrote a poem for you and I hid it in a book in your house 

I wanted to hide a part of myself somewhere close to you

I bought you a gift and I lost it in a busy street
somewhere in the world

I wanted to gift you the opportunity to come and find it 

I met people and I told your story to them

Pain isn't meant to be shared 

but I thought someone might find courage in you

Life hides in the places we never look

Like me hiding in a book in your house

The things we want, lie on the streets we haven't walked yet 

We will look into eyes that understand us without speech 

This world is full of dusty books with hidden poems
lost gifts
and open roads

I'm not sure what is the point of this journey 

But I know each step leads to the future

Even the ones we take to avoid it
